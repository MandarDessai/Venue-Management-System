The website is used for resolving an obvious problem of venue management/booking system.
In this page anyone who is searching for a venue/ location for any organising any particular
event may fill in the form along with his requirements like (date, budget, food required, details 
of the eveny , number of people attending the event, decoration needed etc etc). This data is stored 
on the server wherein it maybe used to filter out the options from the venues that are hosted on the website.
Those who own a place and wish to rent it out for an event/ function also have a form under the want to host tab,
 wherein they may fill in the specific details of their venue( location, area, number of people it can host, price, food etc) 
and these details are stored on the server and maybe used to filter and give out results whenever anyone wants to
search for the avaliable options. The page also has the contact tab which can be used to drop in any query if need be.
